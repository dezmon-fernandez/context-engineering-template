# Deep Project Priming

**Focus Area:** $1
**Specific Concern:** $2

## Project Discovery Process

### 1. Map the Structure

Run these to understand project layout:

- `tree -L 3 -I 'node_modules|__pycache__|.git|dist|build|coverage'`
- `find . -type d -name "src" -o -name "lib" -o -name "app" | head -10`
- `ls -la`

### 2. Read Foundation Files

Start with these core documents:

- README.md and CLAUDE.md (understand project goals and guidelines)
- Package files (package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, Cargo.toml)
- Configuration files (._rc, _.config.\*, .env.example)
- Main entry points based on language

### 3. Focus Deep Dive: $1

Based on "$1" focus area, investigate these specific areas:

**If "frontend" or "ui":**

- Find and read main component files
- Identify state management approach
- Check routing configuration
- Review styling system

**If "backend" or "api":**

- Read API route definitions
- Find database models/schemas
- Check middleware setup
- Review service layers

**If "testing":**

- Find test examples
- Identify testing patterns
- Check test configuration
- Review test utilities

**If "performance":**

- Search for caching logic
- Find optimization configs
- Look for monitoring setup
- Check build configurations

**If "security":**

- Find authentication code
- Review authorization logic
- Check input validation
- Look for security configs

**If "database":**

- Read schema definitions
- Find migration files
- Check ORM setup
- Review query patterns

### 4. Address Specific Concern: $2

For "$2", search and read:

- Files containing related keywords
- Similar implementations already in codebase
- Relevant tests or examples
- Documentation about this concern

### 5. Identify Patterns

From your reading, note:

- **Code Style**: How is code organized and formatted?
- **Architecture**: What patterns are being followed?
- **Dependencies**: What libraries are heavily used?
- **Conventions**: Naming, file structure, common approaches

## Summary Report

### üìä Project Intelligence
